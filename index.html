For my final project I want to create a website that can display my mom's photography. I would have a homepage introducing her and explaining where her hobby began. In the other pages I would display her photos. Each page would categorized by the type of photo (sports photos, nature photos, travel photos, & family) The pages would have explanations behind the photos and where they were taken. I plan to pull together her best photos.
